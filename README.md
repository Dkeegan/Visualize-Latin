# Visualize-Latin
A website that shows images of a representation of a Latin word.

The goal is to help facilitate the natural language model to learn Latin. The word is supposed to be associated with the pictures that are shown. However, the fatal flaw is abstract ideas that are hard to represent.

# TODO:
- Auto check correctness if translated
- Make it clear that translation is not necessary (as translation goes against the model)
- Clean up the front end to make it look pretty
- Remove the hidden English word in the front end and move it so it is only in the backend
- Currently there are the top 100 nouns in the list. I should remove words that do not work
- Add word in ***lingua latina per se illustrata*** as that is the main book to learn Latin
- Fix the  "CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'" issue with from the api without use of a extension 
- Deploy it
- Add multiple sources of pictures
- Add an option to see alternative translations
- Add the ability to have user sourced words
- Add the ability to upload pictures to demonstrate words vs relying on third part api's 
- Gameify it (remove the Latin word from the page and have it check  to see if that is the word. This would require an extremely curated list of pictures)
- Throw in conjugations instead of the base word ( This is probably in the api or I would have to build my own. It also might not be helpful in the learning process)
- Meme mode. Only pictures based on memes.
